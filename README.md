# Pushy
Pushy began as a test program implementing [postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation#Postfix_algorithm). Now, it's just a terrible, stack-based, integer-only language. 

To run a program, download the two scripts in this git (Python 3) and use the following command line syntax:

```$ pushy <file> [input]```

Pushy is still in development and features may disappear/change without warning.
